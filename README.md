### üê± Adding Songs

1. Use a DAW, such as [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), to chart and export your song. Include a three measure count-in at the start, and align the first beat of the song with the third measure.
2. Follow this key for charting:

   **Paw Percussion**:
    - Place notes in C3 (60)

   **Feline Fretboard**:
    - Lane 1: E3 (64)
      - Lift notes: B2 (59)
    - Lane 2: D#3 (63)
      - Lift notes: A#2 (58)
    - Lane 3: D3 (62)
      - Lift notes: A2 (57)
    - Lane 4: C#3 (61)
      - Lift notes: G#2 (56)
    - To chart sustain notes, extend the duration of the note

   **Pouncing Parade**:
    - Place notes in F3 (65) - A#3 (70)

   **Bongo Bash**:
    - Outer Left: C#4 (73)
    - Inner Left: C4 (72)
    - Inner Right: B3 (71)
    - Outer Right: D4 (74)

3. Export your song in a compatible format, and place it in the `Assets/Audio/Songs` folder
4. Export your MIDI and place it in the `Assets/StreamingAssets` folder
5. Add the album art to the `Assets/Textures/AlbumArt` folder (ensure it is POT)
6. Create a new `SongData` asset in the `Assets/Songs` folder, and fill in the details
7. Add your song audio and album art to the **Songs** addressable group; and add a label for the song e.g. `songname` + `songasset` & `titledownload`. Then add the song data to the `SongData` addressable group; and add a label for the song e.g. `songname` + `songdata`
8. To test out your new song, set it as the default song in the **SongManager** script under the **Music** object in the **GameSystems** scene, then open a `_xxBase` scene to test that gameplay mode
